# Tic Tac Toe 

One basic implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe.

It's made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (God bless [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon))

This is a personal non-profit project that has the following purposes:

1. Make it easier for me to try new libraries and new React features.
2. A way to show how I program to anyone who might be interested. If you are interested in hiring me, you can contact me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-cort%C3%A9s-2508b41b/).
3. Educational purposes. I think that a complete project like this can be a very interesting example for people anyone who is learning React. If this is your case, I encourage you to continue with your learning, I can tell you I have never known a cooler way to create web apps. If I can help you with something don't hesitate to contact me, I'll be happy to help you, in English, French or Spanish.


Do you want to use this project for commercial purposes? I don't have a problem with that, you can use it for free ðŸ˜‰
